       "'Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces\\nAlbertGu*1 andTriDao*2\\n1MachineLearningDepartment,CarnegieMellonUniversity\\n2DepartmentofComputerScience,PrincetonUniversity\\nagu@cs.cmu.edu,tri@tridao.me\\nAbstract\\nFoundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally\\nbased on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures\\nsuch as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs)\\nhave been developed to address Transformers’ computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not\\nperformed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of\\nsuchmodelsistheirinabilitytoperformcontent-basedreasoning,andmakeseveralimprovements. First,simply\\nlettingtheSSMparametersbefunctionsoftheinputaddressestheirweaknesswithdiscretemodalities,allowing\\nthe model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on\\nthe current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a\\nhardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified\\nend-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast\\ninference (5× higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance\\nimproves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves\\nstate-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language\\nmodeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice\\nits size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\\n1 Introduction\\nFoundation models (FMs), or large models pretrained on massive data then adapted for downstream tasks, have\\nemerged as an effective paradigm in modern machine learning. The backbone of these FMs are often sequence\\nmodels, operating on arbitrary sequences of inputs from a wide variety of domains such as language, images,\\nspeech, audio, time series, and genomics (Brown et al. 2020; Dosovitskiy et al. 2020; Ismail Fawaz et al. 2019;\\nOord et al. 2016; Poli et al. 2023; Sutskever, Vinyals, and Quoc V Le 2014). While this concept is agnostic to\\na particular choice of model architecture, modern FMs are predominantly based on a single type of sequence\\nmodel: the Transformer (Vaswani et al. 2017) and its core attention layer (Bahdanau, Cho, and Bengio 2015)\\nThe efficacy of self-attention is attributed to its ability to route information densely within a context window,\\nallowing it to model complex data. However, this property brings fundamental drawbacks: an inability to model\\nanything outside of a finite window, and quadratic scaling with respect to the window length. An enormous body\\nof research has appeared on more efficient variants of attention to overcome these drawbacks (Tay, Dehghani,\\nBahri, et al. 2022), but often at the expense of the very properties that makes it effective. As of yet, none of these\\nvariants have been shown to be empirically effective at scale across domains.\\nRecently, structured state space sequence models (SSMs) (Gu, Goel, and Ré 2022; Gu, Johnson, Goel, et al. 2021)\\nhave emerged as a promising class of architectures for sequence modeling. These models can be interpreted as a\\ncombination of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), with inspiration\\nfrom classical state space models (Kalman 1960). This class of models can be computed very efficiently as either a\\nrecurrence or convolution, with linear or near-linear scaling in sequence length. Additionally, they have principled\\n*Equalcontribution.\\n1mechanisms for modeling long-range dependencies (Gu, Dao, et al. 2020) in certain data modalities, and have\\ndominated benchmarks such as the Long Range Arena (Tay, Dehghani, Abnar, et al. 2021). Many flavors of\\nSSMs (Gu, Goel, and Ré 2022; Gu, Gupta, et al. 2022; Gupta, Gu, and Berant 2022; Y. Li et al. 2023; Ma et al.\\n2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023) have been successful in domains involving\\ncontinuous signal data such as audio and vision (Goel et al. 2022; Nguyen, Goel, et al. 2022; Saon, Gupta, and Cui\\n2023). However, they have been less effective at modeling discrete and information-dense data such as text.\\nWe propose a new class of selective state space models, that improves on prior work on several axes to achieve the\\nmodeling power of Transformers while scaling linearly in sequence length.\\nSelection Mechanism. First, we identify a key limitation of prior models: the ability to efficiently select\\ndata in an input-dependent manner (i.e. focus on or ignore particular inputs). Building on intuition based on\\nimportant synthetic tasks such as selective copy and induction heads, we design a simple selection mechanism by\\nparameterizing the SSM parameters based on the input. This allows the model to filter out irrelevant information\\nand remember relevant information indefinitely.\\nHardware-awareAlgorithm. This simple change poses a technical challenge for the computation of the model;\\nin fact, all prior SSMs models must be time- and input-invariant in order to be computationally efficient. We\\novercome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that computes the model recurrently with a scan instead of\\nconvolution, but does not materialize the expanded state in order to avoid IO access between different levels of the\\nGPU memory hierarchy. The resulting implementation is faster than previous methods both in theory (scaling\\nlinearly in sequence length, compared to pseudo-linear for all convolution-based SSMs) and on modern hardware\\n(up to 3× faster on A100 GPUs).\\nArchitecture. We simplify prior deep sequence model architectures by combining the design of prior SSM\\narchitectures (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) with the MLP block of Transformers into a single block, leading to a\\nsimple and homogenous architecture design (Mamba) incorporating selective state spaces.\\nSelective SSMs, and by extension the Mamba architecture, are fully recurrent models with key properties that\\nmake them suitable as the backbone of general foundation models operating on sequences. (i) High quality:\\nselectivity brings strong performance on dense modalities such as language and genomics. (ii) Fast training and\\ninference: computation and memory scales linearly in sequence length during training, and unrolling the model\\nautoregressively during inference requires only constant time per step since it does not require a cache of previous\\nelements. (iii) Long context: the quality and efficiency together yield performance improvements on real data up\\nto sequence length 1M.\\nWe empirically validate Mamba’s potential as a general sequence FM backbone, in both pretraining quality and\\ndomain-specific task performance, on several types of modalities and settings:\\n• Synthetics. On important synthetic tasks such as copying and induction heads that have been proposed as being\\nkey to large language models, Mamba not only solves them easily but can extrapolate solutions indefinitely long\\n(>1M tokens).\\n• AudioandGenomics. Mambaout-performspriorstate-of-the-artmodelssuchasSaShiMi,Hyena,andTransform-\\ners on modeling audio waveforms and DNA sequences, both in pretraining quality and downstream metrics (e.g.\\nreducing FID on a challenging speech generation dataset by more than half). In both settings, its performance\\nimproves with longer context up to million-length sequences.\\n• Language Modeling. Mamba is the first linear-time sequence model that truly achieves Transformer-quality\\nperformance,bothinpretrainingperplexityanddownstreamevaluations. Withscalinglawsupto1Bparameters,\\nwe show that Mamba exceeds the performance of a large range of baselines, including very strong modern\\nTransformer training recipes based on LLaMa (Touvron et al. 2023). Our Mamba language model has 5×\\ngeneration throughput compared to Transformers of similar size, and Mamba-3B’s quality matches that of\\nTransformers twice its size (e.g. 4 points higher avg. on common sense reasoning compared to Pythia-3B and\\neven exceeding Pythia-7B).\\nModel code and pre-trained checkpoints are open-sourced at https://github.com/state-spaces/mamba.\\n2Selective State Space Model\\nwithHardware-aware State Expansion\\n𝐴\\nℎ ℎ\\n!\"# !\\n𝑥 𝑦\\n!

Theyareinspiredbyaparticularcontinuous\\nsystem (1) that maps a 1-dimensional function or sequence 𝑥(𝑡)∈ℝ↦𝑦(𝑡)∈ℝ through an implicit latent state\\nℎ(𝑡)∈ℝ𝑁\\n.\\nConcretely, S4 models are defined with four parameters (∆,A,B,C), which define a sequence-to-sequence trans-\\nformation in two stages.\\nℎ′(𝑡)=Aℎ(𝑡)+B𝑥(𝑡) (1a) ℎ 𝑡 =Aℎ 𝑡−1+B𝑥 𝑡 (2a) 𝑲 =(C𝑩,C𝑨𝑩,…,C𝑨𝑘 𝑩,…) (3a)\\n𝑦(𝑡)=Cℎ(𝑡) (1b) 𝑦\\n𝑡\\n=Cℎ\\n𝑡\\n(2b)\\n𝑦 =𝑥 ∗𝑲 (3b)\\nDiscretization. Thefirststagetransformsthe“continuousparameters” (∆,A,B)to“discreteparameters” (A,B)\\nthrough fixed formulas A=𝑓 𝐴(∆,A) and B =𝑓 𝐵(∆,A,B), where the pair (𝑓 𝐴,𝑓 𝐵) is called a discretization rule.\\nVarious rules can be used such as the zero-order hold (ZOH) defined in equation (4).\\nA=exp(∆A) B =(∆A)−1(exp(∆A)−I)⋅∆B (4)\\nDiscretization has deep connections to continuous-time systems which can endow them with additional properties\\nsuch as resolution invariance (Nguyen, Goel, et al. 2022) and automatically ensuring that the model is properly\\nnormalized(Gu,Johnson,Timalsina,etal.2023;Orvietoetal.2023). Italsohasconnectionstogatingmechanisms\\nof RNNs (Gu, Gulcehre, et al. 2020; Tallec and Ollivier 2018) which we will revisit in Section 3.5. However, from\\na mechanical point of view discretization can simply be viewed as the first step of the computation graph in the\\nforward pass of an SSM. Alternate flavors of SSMs can bypass the discretization step and parameterize (A,B)\\ndirectly instead (Zhang et al. 2023), which may be easier to reason about.\\nComputation. After the parameters have been transformed from (∆,A,B,C)↦(A,B,C), the model can be\\ncomputed in two ways, either as a linear recurrence (2) or a global convolution (3).\\n3Commonly, the model uses the convolutional mode (3) for efficient parallelizable training (where the whole input\\nsequence is seen ahead of time), and switched into recurrent mode (2) for efficient autoregressive inference (where\\nthe inputs are seen one timestep at a time).\\nLinearTimeInvariance(LTI). An important property of equations (1) to (3) is that the model’s dynamics are\\nconstant through time. In other words (∆,A,B,C), and consequently (A,B) as well, are fixed for all time-steps.\\nThis property is called linear time invariance (LTI), which is deeply connected to recurrence and convolutions.\\nInformally, we think of LTI SSMs as being equivalent to any linear recurrence (2a) or convolution (3b), and use\\nLTI as an umbrella term for these classes of models.\\nThus far, all structured SSMs have been LTI (e.g. computed as convolutions) because of fundamental efficiency\\nconstraints, discussed in Section 3.3. However, a core insight of this work is that LTI models have fundamental\\nlimitations in modeling certain types of data, and our technical contributions involve removing the LTI constraint\\nwhile overcoming the efficiency bottlenecks.\\nStructureandDimensions. Finally, we note that structured SSMs are so named because computing them\\nefficiently also requires imposing structure on the A matrix. The most popular form of structure is diagonal\\n(Gu, Gupta, et al. 2022; Gupta, Gu, and Berant 2022; Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), which we also\\nuse.\\nIn this case, the A∈ℝ𝑁×𝑁,B ∈ℝ𝑁×1,C ∈ℝ1×𝑁 matrices can all be represented by 𝑁 numbers. To operate over\\nan input sequence 𝑥 of batch size 𝐵 and length 𝐿 with 𝐷 channels, the SSM is applied independently to each\\nchannel. Note that in this case, the total hidden state has dimension 𝐷𝑁 per input, and computing it over the\\nsequence length requires 𝑂(𝐵𝐿𝐷𝑁) time and memory; this is the root of the fundamental efficiency bottleneck\\naddressed in Section 3.3.\\nGeneralStateSpaceModels. We note that the term state space model has a very broad meaning which simply\\nrepresents the notion of any recurrent process with a latent state. It has been used to refer to many disparate\\nconcepts in different disciplines, including Markov decision processes (MDP) (reinforcement learning (Hafner\\net al. 2020)), dynamic causal modeling (DCM) (computational neuroscience (Friston, Harrison, and Penny 2003)),\\nKalman filters (controls (Kalman 1960)), hidden Markov models (HMM) and linear dynamical systems (LDS)\\n(machine learning), and recurrent (and sometimes convolutional) models at large (deep learning).\\nThroughout this entire paper we use the term “SSM” to refer exclusively to the class of structured SSMs or S4\\nmodels (Gu, Goel, and Ré 2022; Gu, Gupta, et al. 2022; Gupta, Gu, and Berant 2022; Hasani et al. 2023; Ma et al.\\n2023; Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023) and use these terms interchangeably. For convenience we may also\\ninclude derivatives of such models, such as those focusing on either the linear-recurrence or global-convolution\\nviewpoints (Y. Li et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Poli et al. 2023), and clarify nuances when necessary.\\nSSMArchitectures. SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be incorporated into end-to-end\\nneural network architectures. (We also sometimes call SSM architectures SSNNs, which are to SSM layers as\\nCNNs are to linear convolution layers.) We discuss some of the most well-known SSM architectures, many of\\nwhich will also serve as our primary baselines.\\n• Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) is an approximation of self-attention involving a recurrence which\\ncan be viewed as a degenerate linear SSM.\\n• H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) generalized this recurrence to use S4; it can be viewed as an architecture with\\nan SSM sandwiched by two gated connections (Figure 3). H3 also inserts a standard local convolution, which\\nthey frame as a shift-SSM, before the main SSM layer.\\n• Hyena (Poli et al. 2023) uses the same architecture as H3 but replaces the S4 layer with an MLP-parameterized\\nglobal convolution (Romero et al. 2021).\\n• RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) adds an additional gate to the architecture and uses a simpler SSM, allowing\\nan alternative parallelizable computation path, using a variant of multi-head attention (MHA) instead of\\nconvolutions.\\n4• RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is a recent RNN designed for language modeling based on another linear attention\\napproximation (attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021)). Its main “WKV” mechanism involves LTI\\nrecurrences and can be viewed as the ratio of two SSMs.\\nOther closely related SSMs and architectures are discussed further in an extended related work (Appendix B). We\\nhighlight in particular S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), and SRU (Lei\\net al. 2017), which we view as the most closely related methods to our core selective SSM.\\n3 Selective State Space Models\\nWe motivate our selection mechanism using intuition from synthetic tasks (Section 3.1), then explain how to\\nincorporate this mechanism into state space models (Section 3.2). The resulting time-varying SSMs cannot\\nuse convolutions, presenting a technical challenge of how to compute them efficiently. We overcome this with\\na hardware-aware algorithm that exploits the memory hierarchy on modern hardware (Section 3.3). We then\\ndescribe a simple SSM architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Section 3.4). Finally, we discuss some\\nadditional properties of selection mechanisms (Section 3.5).\\n3.1 Motivation: SelectionasaMeansofCompression\\nWe argue that a fundamental problem of sequence modeling is compressing context into a smaller state. In fact,\\nwe can view the tradeoffs of popular sequence models from this point of view. For example, attention is both\\neffective and inefficient because it explicitly does not compress context at all. This can be seen from the fact that\\nautoregressive inference requires explicitly storing the entire context (i.e. the KV cache), which directly causes the\\nslow linear-time inference and quadratic-time training of Transformers. On the other hand, recurrent models are\\nefficient because they have a finite state, implying constant-time inference and linear-time training. However, their\\neffectiveness is limited by how well this state has compressed the context.\\nTo understand this principle, we focus on two running examples of synthetic tasks (Figure 2).\\n• The Selective Copying task modifies the popular Copying task (Arjovsky, Shah, and Bengio 2016) by varying\\nthe position of the tokens to memorize. It requires content-aware reasoning to be able to memorize the relevant\\ntokens (colored) and filter out the irrelevant ones (white).\\n• TheInductionHeadstaskisawell-knownmechanismhypothesizedtoexplainthemajorityofin-contextlearning\\nabilities of LLMs (Olsson et al. 2022). It requires context-aware reasoning to know when to produce the correct\\noutput in the appropriate context (black).\\nThese tasks reveal the failure mode of LTI models. From the recurrent view, their constant dynamics (e.g. the\\n(A,B) transitions in (2)) cannot let them select the correct information from their context, or affect the hidden\\nstate passed along the sequence an in input-dependent way. From the convolutional view, it is known that global\\nconvolutions can solve the vanilla Copying task (Romero et al. 2021) because it only requires time-awareness,\\nbut that they have difficulty with the Selective Copying task because of lack of content-awareness (Figure 2).\\nMore concretely, the spacing between inputs-to-outputs is varying and cannot be modeled by static convolution\\nkernels.\\nIn summary, the efficiency vs. effectiveness tradeoff of sequence models is characterized by how well they compress\\ntheir state: efficient models must have a small state, while effective models must have a state that contains all\\nnecessary information from the context. In turn, we propose that a fundamental principle for building sequence\\nmodels is selectivity: or the context-aware ability to focus on or filter out inputs into a sequential state. In\\nparticular, a selection mechanism controls how information propagates or interacts along the sequence dimension\\n(see Section 3.5 for more discussion).\\n3.2 ImprovingSSMswithSelection\\nOne method of incorporating a selection mechanism into models is by letting their parameters that affect\\ninteractions along the sequence (e.g. the recurrent dynamics of an RNN or the convolution kernel of a CNN) be\\ninput-dependent.\\n5Copying Selective Copying\\nOutput Output\\nInput Input\\nInduction Heads\\nSolution\\nPerfectly solved by LTI (e.g.convolutional) models that do not need to look at the actual inputs ?\\nFigure2: (Left)ThestandardversionoftheCopyingtaskinvolvesconstantspacingbetweeninputandoutputelementsandis\\neasilysolvedbytime-invariantmodelssuchaslinearrecurrencesandglobalconvolutions.

The main difference is simply making\\nseveral parameters ∆,B,C functions of the input, along with the associated changes to tensor shapes throughout.\\nIn particular, we highlight that these parameters now have a length dimension 𝐿, meaning that the model has\\nchanged from time-invariant to time-varying. (Note that shape annotations were described in Section 2). This\\nloses the equivalence to convolutions (3) with implications for its efficiency, discussed next.\\nWe specifically choose 𝑠 𝐵(𝑥) = 𝖫𝗂𝗇𝖾𝖺𝗋 𝑁(𝑥), 𝑠 𝐶(𝑥) = 𝖫𝗂𝗇𝖾𝖺𝗋 𝑁(𝑥), 𝑠 ∆(𝑥) = 𝖡𝗋𝗈𝖺𝖽𝖼𝖺𝗌𝗍 𝐷(𝖫𝗂𝗇𝖾𝖺𝗋 1(𝑥)), and 𝜏 ∆ = 𝗌𝗈𝖿𝗍𝗉𝗅𝗎𝗌,\\nwhere 𝖫𝗂𝗇𝖾𝖺𝗋 𝑑 is a parameterized projection to dimension 𝑑. The choice of 𝑠 ∆ and 𝜏 ∆ is due to a connection to\\nRNN gating mechanisms explained in Section 3.5.\\n3.3 EfficientImplementationofSelectiveSSMs\\nHardware-friendly architectures such as convolutions (Krizhevsky, Sutskever, and Hinton 2012) and Transform-\\ners (Vaswani et al. 2017) enjoy widespread application. Here we aim to make selective SSMs efficient on modern\\nhardware (GPU) as well. The selection mechanism is quite natural, and earlier works attempted to incorporate\\nspecial cases of selection, such as letting ∆ vary over time in recurrent SSMs (Gu, Dao, et al. 2020). However, as\\npreviously mentioned a core limitation in the usage of SSMs is their computational efficiency, which was why S4\\nand all derivatives used LTI (non-selective) models, most commonly in the form of global convolutions.\\n3.3.1 MotivationofPriorModels\\nWe first revisit this motivation and overview our approach to overcome limitations of prior methods.\\n• At a high level, recurrent models such as SSMs always balance a tradeoff between expressivity and speed: as\\ndiscussed in Section 3.1, models with larger hidden state dimension should be more effective but slower. Thus\\n6we want to maximize hidden state dimension without paying speed and memory costs.\\n• Note that the recurrent mode is more flexible than the convolution mode, since the latter (3) is derived from\\nexpanding the former (2) (Gu, Goel, and Ré 2022; Gu, Johnson, Goel, et al. 2021). However, this would require\\ncomputing and materializing the latent state ℎ with shape (𝙱,𝙻,𝙳,𝙽), much larger (by a factor of 𝑁, the SSM\\nstate dimension) than the input 𝑥 and output 𝑦 of shape (𝙱,𝙻,𝙳). Thus the more efficient convolution mode was\\nintroduced which could bypass the state computation and materializes a convolution kernel (3a) of only (𝙱,𝙻,𝙳).\\n• Prior LTI SSMs leverage the dual recurrent-convolutional forms to increase the effective state dimension by a\\nfactor of 𝑁 (≈10−100), much larger than traditional RNNs, without efficiency penalties.\\n3.3.2 OverviewofSelectiveScan: Hardware-AwareStateExpansion\\nThe selection mechanism is designed to overcome the limitations of LTI models; at the same time, we therefore\\nneed to revisit the computation problem of SSMs. We address this with three classical techniques: kernel fusion,\\nparallel scan, and recomputation. We make two main observations:\\n• Thenaiverecurrentcomputationuses𝑂(𝐵𝐿𝐷𝑁)FLOPswhiletheconvolutionalcomputationuses𝑂(𝐵𝐿𝐷log(𝐿))\\nFLOPs, and the former has a lower constant factor. Thus for long sequences and not-too-large state dimension\\n𝑁, the recurrent mode can actually use fewer FLOPs.\\n• The two challenges are the sequential nature of recurrence, and the large memory usage. To address the latter,\\njust like the convolutional mode, we can attempt to not actually materialize the full state ℎ.\\nThe main idea is to leverage properties of modern accelerators (GPUs) to materialize the state ℎ only in more\\nefficient levels of the memory hierarchy. In particular, most operations (except matrix multiplication) are bounded\\nby memory bandwidth (Dao, Fu, Ermon, et al. 2022; Ivanov et al. 2021; Williams, Waterman, and Patterson\\n2009). This includes our scan operation, and we use kernel fusion to reduce the amount of memory IOs, leading to\\na significant speedup compared to a standard implementation.\\nConcretely, instead of preparing the scan input (A,B) of size (𝙱,𝙻,𝙳,𝙽) in GPU HBM (high-bandwidth memory),\\nwe load the SSM parameters (∆,A,B,C) directly from slow HBM to fast SRAM, perform the discretization and\\nrecurrence in SRAM, and then write the final outputs of size (𝙱,𝙻,𝙳) back to HBM.\\nTo avoid the sequential recurrence, we observe that despite not being linear it can still be parallelized with a\\nwork-efficient parallel scan algorithm (Blelloch 1990; Martin and Cundy 2018; Smith, Warrington, and Linderman\\n2023).\\nFinally, we must also avoid saving the intermediate states, which are necessary for backpropagation. We carefully\\napply the classic technique of recomputation to reduce the memory requirements: the intermediate states are not\\nstored but recomputed in the backward pass when the inputs are loaded from HBM to SRAM. As a result, the\\nfused selective scan layer has the same memory requirements as an optimized transformer implementation with\\nFlashAttention.\\nDetails of the fused kernel and recomputation are in Appendix D. The full Selective SSM layer and algorithm is\\nillustrated in Figure 1.\\n3.4 ASimplifiedSSMArchitecture\\nAswithstructuredSSMs,selectiveSSMsarestandalonesequencetransformationsthatcanbeflexiblyincorporated\\nintoneuralnetworks.

We always fix to 𝐸 =2 in our experiments and use two\\nstacks of the block to match the\\n12𝐷2\\nparameters of a Transformer’s interleaved MHA (multi-head attention) and\\nMLP blocks. We use the SiLU / Swish activation function (Hendrycks and Gimpel 2016; Ramachandran, Zoph,\\nand Quoc V Le 2017), motivated so that the Gated MLP becomes the popular “SwiGLU” variant (Chowdhery\\net al. 2023; Shazeer 2020; Touvron et al. 2023). Finally, we additionally use an optional normalization layer (we\\nchoose LayerNorm (J. L. Ba, Kiros, and Hinton 2016)), motivated by RetNet’s usage of a normalization layer in a\\nsimilar location (Y. Sun et al. 2023).\\n3.5 PropertiesofSelectionMechanisms\\nThe selection mechanism is a broader concept that can be applied in different ways, such as to more traditional\\nRNNs or CNNs, to different parameters (e.g. A in Algorithm 2), or using different transformations 𝑠(𝑥).\\n3.5.1 ConnectiontoGatingMechanisms\\nWehighlightthemostimportantconnection: theclassicalgatingmechanismofRNNsisaninstanceofourselection\\nmechanism for SSMs. We note that the connection between RNN gating and the discretization of continuous-time\\nsystems is well established (Funahashi and Nakamura 1993; Tallec and Ollivier 2018). In fact, Theorem 1 is\\nan improvement of Gu, Johnson, Goel, et al. (2021, Lemma 3.1) generalizing to the ZOH discretization and\\ninput-dependent gates (proof in Appendix C). More broadly, ∆ in SSMs can be seen to play a generalized role\\nof the RNN gating mechanism. In line with prior work, we adopt the view that discretization of SSMs is the\\nprincipled foundation of heuristic gating mechanisms.\\nTheorem 1. When 𝑁 = 1,A = −1,B = 1,𝑠 ∆ = 𝖫𝗂𝗇𝖾𝖺𝗋(𝑥), and 𝜏 ∆ = 𝗌𝗈𝖿𝗍𝗉𝗅𝗎𝗌, then the selective SSM recurrence\\n(Algorithm2)takestheform\\n𝑔 =𝜎(𝖫𝗂𝗇𝖾𝖺𝗋(𝑥 ))\\n𝑡 𝑡\\n(5)\\nℎ =(1−𝑔 )ℎ +𝑔 𝑥 .\\n𝑡 𝑡 𝑡−1 𝑡 𝑡\\nAs mentioned in Section 3.2, our specific choices of 𝑠 ∆,𝜏 ∆ is from this connection. In particular, note that if a\\ngiven input 𝑥 𝑡 should be completely ignored (as necessary in the synthetic tasks), all 𝐷 channels should ignore it,\\nand so we project the input down to 1 dimension before repeating/broadcasting with ∆.\\n83.5.2 InterpretationofSelectionMechanisms\\nWe elaborate on two particular mechanistic effects of selection.\\nVariable Spacing. Selectivity allows filtering out irrelevant noise tokens that may occur between inputs of\\ninterest. This is exemplified by the Selective Copying task, but occurs ubiquitously in common data modalities,\\nparticularly for discrete data – for example the presence of language fillers such as “um”. This property arises\\nbecause the model can mechanistically filter out any particular input 𝑥 𝑡, for example in the gated RNN case\\n(Theorem 1) when 𝑔 𝑡 →0.\\nFilteringContext. It has been empirically observed that many sequence models do not improve with longer\\ncontext (F. Shi et al. 2023), despite the principle that more context should lead to strictly better performance. An\\nexplanation is that many sequence models cannot effectively ignore irrelevant context when necessary; an intuitive\\nexample are global convolutions (and general LTI models). On the other hand, selective models can simply reset\\ntheir state at any time to remove extraneous history, and thus their performance in principle improves monotonicly\\nwith context length (e.g. Section 4.3.2).\\nBoundaryResetting. In settings where multiple independent sequences are stitched together, Transformers\\ncan keep them separate by instantiating a particular attention mask, while LTI models will bleed information\\nbetween the sequences. Selective SSMs can also reset their state at boundaries (e.g. ∆ 𝑡 →∞ or Theorem 1 when\\n𝑔 𝑡 →1). These settings may occur artificially (e.g. packing documents together to improve hardware utilization)\\nor naturally (e.g. episode boundaries in reinforcement learning (Lu et al. 2023)).\\nAdditionally, we elaborate on effects of each selective parameter.\\nInterpretationof∆. In general, ∆ controls the balance between how much to focus or ignore the current input\\n𝑥 𝑡. It generalizes RNN gates (e.g. 𝑔 𝑡 in Theorem 1), mechanically, a large ∆ resets the state ℎ and focuses on the\\ncurrentinput𝑥,whileasmall∆persiststhestateandignoresthecurrentinput. SSMs(1)-(2)canbeinterpretedas\\na continuous system discretized by a timestep ∆, and in this context the intuition is that large ∆→∞ represents\\nthe system focusing on the current input for longer (thus “selecting” it and forgetting its current state) while a\\nsmall ∆→0 represents a transient input that is ignored.\\nInterpretationofA. We remark that while the A parameter could also be selective, it ultimately affects the\\nmodel only through its interaction with ∆ via A = exp(∆A) (the discretization (4)). Thus selectivity in ∆ is\\nenough to ensure selectivity in (A,B), and is the main source of improvement. We hypothesize that making A\\nselective in addition to (or instead of) ∆ would have similar performance, and leave it out for simplicity.\\nInterpretationofBandC. As discussed in Section 3.1, the most important property of selectivity is filtering\\nout irrelevant information so that a sequence model’s context can be compressed into an efficient state. In an SSM,\\nmodifying B and C to be selective allows finer-grained control over whether to let an input 𝑥 𝑡 into the state ℎ 𝑡 or\\nthe state into the output 𝑦 𝑡. These can be interpreted as allowing the model to modulate the recurrent dynamics\\nbased on content (input) and context (hidden states) respectively.\\n3.6 AdditionalModelDetails\\nReal vs. Complex. Most prior SSMs use complex numbers in their state ℎ, which is necessary for strong\\nperformance on many tasks (Gu, Goel, and Ré 2022). However, it has been empirically observed that completely\\nreal-valued SSMs seem to work fine, and possibly even better, in some settings (Ma et al. 2023). We use real\\nvalues as the default, which work well for all but one of our tasks; we hypothesize that the complex-real tradeoff is\\nrelated to the continuous-discrete spectrum in data modalities, where complex numbers are helpful for continuous\\nmodalities (e.g. audio, video) but not discrete (e.g. text, DNA).\\n9Initialization. Most prior SSMs also suggest special initializations, particularly in the complex-valued case,\\nwhich can help in several settings such as low-data regimes. Our default initialization for the complex case is\\nS4D-Lin and for the real case is S4D-Real (Gu, Gupta, et al. 2022), which is based on the HIPPO theory (Gu,\\nDao, et al. 2020). These define the 𝑛-th element of A as −1∕2+𝑛𝑖 and −(𝑛+1) respectively. However, we expect\\nmany initializations to work fine, particularly in the large-data and real-valued SSM regimes; some ablations are\\nconsidered in Section 4.6.\\nParameterizationof∆. We defined the selective adjustment to ∆ as 𝑠 ∆(𝑥)=𝖡𝗋𝗈𝖺𝖽𝖼𝖺𝗌𝗍 𝐷(𝖫𝗂𝗇𝖾𝖺𝗋 1(𝑥)), which was\\nmotivated by the mechanics of ∆ (Section 3.5). We observe that it can be generalized from dimension 1 to a larger\\ndimension 𝚁. We set this to be a small fraction of 𝙳, which uses a negligible number of parameters compared to\\nthe main Linear projections in the block. We additionally note that the broadcasting operation can instead be\\nviewed as another Linear projection, initialized to a specific pattern of 1’s and 0’s; if this projection is trainable,\\nthis leads to the alternative 𝑠 ∆(𝑥)=𝖫𝗂𝗇𝖾𝖺𝗋 𝐷(𝖫𝗂𝗇𝖾𝖺𝗋 𝑅(𝑥)), which can be viewed as a low-rank projection.\\nInourexperiments,the∆parameter(whichcanbeviewedasabiasterm)isinitializedto𝜏−1(𝖴𝗇𝗂𝖿𝗈𝗋𝗆([0.001,0.1])),\\n∆\\nfollowing prior work on SSMs (Gu, Johnson, Timalsina, et al. 2023).\\nRemark3.1.

We then evaluate\\non three domains, each evaluated on autoregressive pretraining as well as downstream tasks.\\n• Section 4.2: language model pretraining (scaling laws), and zero-shot downstream evaluation.\\n• Section 4.3: DNA sequence pretraining, and fine-tuning on a long-sequence classification task.\\n• Section 4.4: audio waveform pretraining, and the quality of autoregressively generated speech clips.\\nFinally, Section 4.5 shows Mamba’s computational efficiency at both training and inference time, and Section 4.6\\nablates various components of the architecture and selective SSMs.\\n4.1 SyntheticTasks\\nFull experiment details for these tasks including task details and training protocol are in Appendix E.1.\\n4.1.1 SelectiveCopying\\nThe Copying task is one of the most well-studied synthetic tasks for sequence modeling, originally designed to test\\nthe memorization abilities of recurrent models. As discussed in Section 3.1, LTI SSMs (linear recurrences and\\nglobalconvolutions)caneasilysolvethistaskbyonlykeepingtrackoftimeinsteadofreasoningaboutthedata; for\\nexample, by constructing a convolution kernel of exactly the right length (Figure 2). This was explicitly validated\\nin earlier work on global convolutions (Romero et al. 2021). The Selective Copying task prevents this shortcut\\nby randomizing the spacing between tokens. Note that this task has been introduced before as the Denoising\\ntask (Jing et al. 2019).\\nNote that many previous works argue that adding architecture gating (multiplicative interactions) can endow\\nmodels with “data-dependence” and solve related tasks (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023; Poli et al. 2023). However,\\nwe find this explanation insufficient intuitively because such gating does not interact along the sequence axis,\\nand cannot affect the spacing between tokens. In particular architecture gating is not an instance of a selection\\nmechanism (Appendix A).\\nTable 1 confirms that gated architectures such as H3 and Mamba only partially improve performance, while the\\nselection mechanism (modifying S4 to S6) easily solves this task, particularly when combined with these more\\npowerful architectures.\\n10Model Arch.

We train a 2-layer model on the induction heads task at sequence length 256, with a vocab size of\\n16, which is comparable to prior work on this task (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) but with longer sequences. We\\nadditionally investigate generalization and extrapolation abilities by evaluating on a range of sequence lengths\\nfrom 26 =64 up to 220 =1048576 at test time.\\nModels. Following established work on induction heads, we use 2 layer models, which allows attention to\\nmechanistically solve the induction heads task (Olsson et al. 2022). We test both multi-head attention (8 heads,\\nwith various positional encodings) and SSM variants. We use a model dimension 𝐷 of 64 for Mamba and 128 for\\nthe other models.\\nResults. Table 2 shows that Mamba—or more precisely, its selective SSM layer—has the ability to solve the\\ntask perfectly because of its ability to selectively remember the relevant token while ignoring everything else in\\nbetween. It generalizes perfectly to million-length sequences, or 4000× longer than it saw during training, while no\\nother method goes beyond 2×.\\nOut of positional encoding variants for attention models, xPos (which was designed for length extrapolation)\\nis slightly better than the others; also note that all attention models were only tested up to sequence length\\n214 =16384 due to memory limitations.

(2023).\\n4.2 LanguageModeling\\nWe evaluate the Mamba architecture on standard autoregressive language modeling against other architectures, on\\nboth pretraining metrics (perplexity) and zero-shot evaluations. We set the model sizes (depth and width) to\\nmirror GPT3 specifications. We use the Pile dataset (L. Gao, Biderman, et al. 2020), and follow the training\\nrecipe described in Brown et al. (2020).

Models\\nwere trained for 20𝐾 gradient steps for a total of ≈330𝐵 tokens. The longer sequence lengths used sequence length\\nwarmup similar to (Nguyen, Poli, et al. 2023).\\nResults. Figure 5 (Right) shows that Mamba is able to make use of longer context even up to extremely long\\nsequences of length 1M, and its pretraining perplexity improves as the context increases. On the other hand,\\nthe HyenaDNA model gets worse with sequence length. This is intuitive from the discussion in Section 3.5 on\\nproperties of the selection mechanism. In particular, LTI models cannot selectively ignore information; from a\\nconvolutional perspective, a very long convolution kernel is aggregating all information across a long sequence\\n13\\x007\\x00G\\x00E\\x00P\\x00M\\x00R\\x00K\\x00\\x04\\x000\\x00E\\x00[\\x00W\\x00\\x04\\x00S\\x00R\\x00\\x04\\x00X\\x00L\\x00I\\x00\\x04\\x00,\\x00Y\\x00Q\\x00E\\x00R\\x00\\x04\\x00+\\x00I\\x00R\\x00S\\x00Q\\x00I\\x00\\x04\\x00\\x0c\\x00,\\x00+\\x00\\x17\\x00\\x1c\\x00\\r \\x007\\x00G\\x00E\\x00P\\x00M\\x00R\\x00K\\x00\\x04\\x000\\x00E\\x00[\\x00W\\x00\\x04\\x00\\x11\\x00\\x04\\x007\\x00I\\x00U\\x00Y\\x00I\\x00R\\x00G\\x00I\\x00\\x04\\x000\\x00I\\x00R\\x00K\\x00X\\x00L\\x00\\x04\\x00\\x0c\\x00,\\x00+\\x00\\x17\\x00\\x1c\\x00\\r\\n\\x00,\\x00]\\x00I\\x00R\\x00E\\x00(\\x002\\x00% \\x00\\x17\\x00\\x12\\x00\\x14\\x00\\x14 \\x00,\\x00]\\x00I\\x00R\\x00E\\x00(\\x002\\x00%\\x00\\x04\\x00\\x15\\x00\\x12\\x00\\x18\\x001\\n\\x00\\x17\\x00\\x12\\x00\\x15 \\x001\\x00E\\x00Q\\x00F\\x00E \\x001\\x00E\\x00Q\\x00F\\x00E\\x00\\x04\\x00\\x15\\x00\\x12\\x00\\x18\\x001\\n\\x008\\x00V\\x00E\\x00R\\x00W\\x00J\\x00S\\x00V\\x00Q\\x00I\\x00V\\x00\\x0f\\x00\\x0f \\x00\\x16\\x00\\x12\\x00\\x1d\\x00\\x19 \\x001\\x00E\\x00Q\\x00F\\x00E\\x00\\x04\\x00\\x1b\\x001\\n\\x00\\x17\\x00\\x12\\x00\\x14 \\x00\\x16\\x00\\x12\\x00\\x1d\\x00\\x14\\n\\x00\\x16\\x00\\x12\\x00\\x1d \\x00\\x16\\x00\\x12\\x00\\x1c\\x00\\x19\\n\\x00\\x16\\x00\\x12\\x00\\x1c\\x00\\x14\\n\\x00\\x16\\x00\\x12\\x00\\x1c\\n\\x00\\x16\\x00\\x12\\x00\\x1b\\x00\\x19\\n\\x00\\x16\\x00\\x12\\x00\\x1b\\n\\x00\\x15\\x00\\x14\\x00\\x1a \\x00\\x15\\x00\\x14\\x00\\x1b \\x00\\x15\\x00\\x14\\x00\\x17 \\x00\\x15\\x00\\x14\\x00\\x18 \\x00\\x15\\x00\\x14\\x00\\x19 \\x00\\x15\\x00\\x14\\x00\\x1a\\n\\x004\\x00E\\x00V\\x00E\\x00Q\\x00I\\x00X\\x00I\\x00V\\x00W\\x00\\x04\\x00\\x0c\\x00P\\x00S\\x00K\\x00\\x04\\x00W\\x00G\\x00E\\x00P\\x00I\\x00\\r \\x007\\x00I\\x00U\\x00Y\\x00I\\x00R\\x00G\\x00I\\x00\\x04\\x000\\x00I\\x00R\\x00K\\x00X\\x00L\\nFigure5: (DNAScalingLaws.)

This model comprises\\n1. a U-Net backbone with two stages of pooling by a factor 𝑝 that doubles the model dimension 𝐷 per stage,\\n2. alternating S4 and MLP blocks in each stage.\\nWe consider replacing the S4+MLP blocks with Mamba blocks. Experiment details are in Appendix E.4.\\n4.4.1 Long-ContextAutoregressivePretraining\\nWe evaluate pretraining quality (autoregressive next-sample prediction) on YouTubeMix (DeepSound 2017), a\\nstandard piano music dataset used by prior work consisting of 4 hours of solo piano music, sampled at a rate of\\n14\\n\\x00]\\x00G\\x00E\\x00V\\x00Y\\x00G\\x00G\\x00%\\n\\x00]\\x00X\\x00M\\x00\\\\\\x00I\\x00P\\x00T\\x00V\\x00I\\x004 \\x00]\\x00X\\x00M\\x00\\\\\\x00I\\x00P\\x00T\\x00V\\x00I\\x004\\n\\x00I\\x00X\\x00]\\x00&\\x00\\x04\\x00V\\x00I\\x004\\x00\\x04\\x00W\\x00X\\x00M\\x00&16000 Hz Pretraining details largely follow the standard language modeling setup (Section 4.2). Figure 7 evaluates\\nthe effect of increasing training sequence lengths from 213 =8192 to 220 ≈106 , while keeping computation fixed.\\n(There are some slight edge cases to the way the data is curated, which may lead to kinks in the scaling curves.\\nFor example, only minute-long clips were available so the maximum sequence length is actually bounded by\\n60𝑠⋅16000𝐻𝑧=960000.)\\nBoth Mamba and the SaShiMi (S4+MLP) baseline improve consistently with longer context lengths; Mamba is\\nbetter throughout, and the gap widens at longer lengths. The main metric is bits per byte (BPB), which is a\\nconstant factor log(2) of the standard negative log-likelihood (NLL) loss for pretraining other modalities.\\nWe note one important detail: this is the only experiment in this paper in which we switched from the real\\nparameterization to complex (Section 3.6). We show additional ablations in Appendix E.4.\\n4.4.2 AutoregressiveSpeechGeneration\\nSC09 is a benchmark speech generation dataset (Donahue, McAuley, and Puckette 2019; Warden 2018), consisting\\nof 1-second clips sampled at 16000 Hz of the digits “zero” through “nine” with highly variable characteristics. We\\nlargely follow the autoregressive training setup and generation protocol of Goel et al. (2022).\\nTable 4 shows automated metrics of the Mamba-UNet model compared to a variety of baselines from Goel et al.\\n(2022): WaveNet(Oordetal.2016),SampleRNN(Mehrietal.2017),WaveGAN(Donahue,McAuley,andPuckette\\n2019), DiffWave (Z. Kong et al. 2021), and SaShiMi. A small Mamba model outperforms the state-of-the-art\\n(and much larger) GAN- and diffusion- based models. A larger model parameter-matched to the baselines further\\nimproves on fidelity metrics dramatically.\\nTable 5 takes the small Mamba model and investigates combinations of different architectures for the outer stages\\nand center stage. It shows that Mamba is consistently better than S4+MLP in the outer blocks, and Mamba >\\nS4+MLP > MHA+MLP in the center blocks.\\nTable4: (SC09)Automatedmetricsforunconditionalgeneration Table5: (SC09ModelAblations)Modelswith6Mparameters.\\non a challenging dataset of fixed-length speech clips.

Our efficient SSM scan is faster than the best attention implementation that\\nwe know of (FlashAttention-2 (Dao 2023)) beyond sequence length 2K, and up to 20-40× faster than a standard\\nscan implementation in PyTorch. Mamba achieves 4-5× higher inference throughput than a Transformer of similar\\nsize, since without the KV cache it can use much higher batch sizes. For example, a Mamba-6.9B (untrained)\\nwould have higher inference throughput than a 5× smaller Transformer-1.3B.

We find that\\n• Among previous non-selective (LTI) SSMs, which are equivalent to global convolutions, performance is very\\nsimilar.\\n• Replacing the complex-valued S4 variant from previous work with a real-valued one does not affect performance\\nmuch, suggesting that (at least for LM) real-valued SSMs may be a better choice when accounting for hardware\\nefficiency.\\n• Replacing any of these with a selective SSM (S6) significantly improves performance, validating the motivation\\nof Section 3.\\n• The Mamba architecture performs similarly to the H3 architecture (and seems slightly better when using a\\nselective layer).\\nWe also investigate interleaving the Mamba block with other blocks such as MLP (a traditional architecture) MHA\\n(a hybrid attention architecture) in Appendix E.2.2.\\n4.6.2 SelectiveSSM\\nTable 7 ablates the selective SSM layer by considering different combinations of selective ∆, B, and C param-\\neters (Algorithm 2), showing that ∆ is the most important parameter due to its connection to RNN gating\\n(Theorem 1).\\nTable 8 considers different initializations of the SSM, which have been shown to make a large difference in some\\ndata modalities and settings (Gu, Goel, and Ré 2022; Gu, Gupta, et al. 2022). On language modeling, we find\\nthat simpler real-valued diagonal initializations (S4D-Real, row 3) instead of more standard complex-valued\\nparameterizations (S4D-Lin, row 1) perform better. Random initializations also work well, consistent with findings\\nfrom prior work (Mehta et al. 2023).\\nTable 9 and Table 10 consider varying the dimension of the ∆ and (B,C) projections respectively. Changing\\nthem from static to selective provides the most benefit, while increasing the dimensions further generally improves\\nperformance modestly with a small increase in parameter count.\\nOf particular note is the dramatic improvement of the selective SSM when the state size 𝑁 is increased, with over\\na 1.0 perplexity improvement for a cost of only 1% additional parameters. This validates our core motivation in\\nSections 3.1 and 3.3.\\n16\\n\\x00\\r\\x00W\\x00Q\\x00\\x0c\\x00\\x04\\x00I\\x00Q\\x00M\\x008\\n\\x00\\r\\x00W\\x00\\x04\\x00\\x13\\x00\\x04\\x00W\\x00R\\x00I\\x00O\\x00S\\x00X\\x00\\x0c\\x00\\x04\\x00X\\x00Y\\x00T\\x00L\\x00K\\x00Y\\x00S\\x00V\\x00L\\x008Table6: (Ablations: ArchitectureandSSMlayer.)

Appendix A discusses how the selection mechanism relates to similar concepts. Appendix B has\\nan extended related work of SSMs and other related models.\\nNoFreeLunch: Continuous-DiscreteSpectrum. Structured SSMs were originally defined as discretizations\\nof continuous systems (1), and have had a strong inductive bias toward continuous-time data modalities such as\\nperceptual signals (e.g. audio, video). As discussed in Sections 3.1 and 3.5, the selection mechanism overcomes\\ntheir weaknesses on discrete modalities such as text and DNA; but this conversely can impede their performance\\n17on data that LTI SSMs excel on. Our ablations on audio waveforms examine this tradeoff in more detail.\\nDownstreamAffordances. Transformer-based foundation models (particularly LLMs) have a rich ecosystem of\\nproperties and modes of interaction with pretrained models, such as fine-tuning, adaptation, prompting, in-context\\nlearning,instructiontuning,RLHF,quantization,andsoon. WeareparticularlyinterestedinwhetherTransformer\\nalternatives such as SSMs have similar properties and affordances.\\nScaling. Our empirical evaluation is limited to small model sizes, below the threshold of most strong open source\\nLLMs (e.g. Llama (Touvron et al. 2023)) as well as other recurrent models such as RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023)\\nand RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023), which have been evaluated at the 7B parameter scale and beyond. It remains to\\nassess whether Mamba still compares favorably at these larger sizes. We also note that scaling SSMs may involve\\nfurther engineering challenges and adjustments to the model that are not discussed in this paper.\\n6 Conclusion\\nWeintroduceaselection mechanismtostructuredstatespace models, allowingthemtoperformcontext-dependent\\nreasoning while scaling linearly in sequence length. When incorporated into a simple attention-free architecture,\\nMamba achieves state-of-the-art results on a diverse set of domains, where it matches or exceeds the performance\\nof strong Transformer models. We are excited about the broad applications of selective state space models to\\nbuild foundation models for different domains, especially in emerging modalities requiring long context such as\\ngenomics, audio, and video. Our results suggest that Mamba is a strong candidate to be a general sequence model\\nbackbone.\\nAcknowledgments\\nWe thank Karan Goel, Arjun Desai, and Kush Bhatia for helpful feedback on the draft.\\nReferences\\n[1] Martin Arjovsky, Amar Shah, and Yoshua Bengio. “Unitary Evolution Recurrent Neural Networks”.

Ba et al. 2016), which connects classical RNNs with the\\nmechanism of linear attention (Schlag, Irie, and Schmidhuber 2021). However, we believe that it is a distinct\\nconcept that is worth clarifying.\\nGating. Gating originally referred to the gating mechanisms of RNNs such as the LSTM (Hochreiter and\\nSchmidhuber 1997) and GRU (J. Chung et al. 2014), or the gated equation (5)n Theorem 1. This was interpreted\\nas a particular mechanism for controlling whether to let an input into the hidden state of an RNN. In particular,\\nthis affects the propagation of signal through time and causes inputs to interact along the sequence length\\ndimension.\\nHowever, the concept of gating has since been relaxed in popular usage to simply mean any multiplicative\\ninteraction (often with an activation function). For example, elementwise multiplicative components of neural\\nnetwork architectures (that do not interact along sequence length) are now commonly referred to as gated\\narchitectures (Hua et al. 2022; Mehta et al. 2023), despite a very different meaning than the original RNN sense.\\nThus we believe the original concept of RNN gating versus the popular usage of multiplicative gating actually\\nhave a very different semantic meaning.\\nHypernetworks. Hypernetworks refer to neural networks whose parameters are themselves generated by smaller\\nneural networks. The original idea (Ha, Dai, and Quoc V. Le 2017) used it in a narrow sense to define a large\\nRNN whose recurrent parameters are generated by a smaller RNN.\\nData-dependence. Similar to hypernetworks, data-dependence can refer to any notion where some parameters\\nof the model depend on the data (Poli et al. 2023).\\nExample: GLU Activation. To illustrate the issues with these concepts, consider a simple diagonal linear\\nlayer 𝑦 = D𝑥, where D is a diagonal weight parameter. Now suppose that D is itself generated from a linear\\ntransformation of 𝑥, with an optional nonlinearity: D =𝜎(W𝑥). Since it is diagonal, the multiplication becomes\\nan elementwise product: 𝑦 =𝜎(W𝑥)◦𝑥.\\nThis is a rather trivial transformation, yet it technically satisfies the common meanings of gating (since it has a\\nmultiplicative“branch”),hypernetworks(sincetheparameterD isgeneratedbyanotherlayer),anddata-dependent\\n(since D depends on the data 𝑥). However, this in fact simply defines a GLU function, which is so simple that\\nit is often considered just an activation function (Dauphin et al. 2017; Shazeer 2020) instead of a meaningful\\nlayer.\\nSelection. Thus, while selection mechanisms could be considered a special case of ideas such as architectural\\ngating, hypernetworks, or data-dependence, so can an enormous range of other constructions—essentially anything\\nwith a multiplication, including standard attention mechanisms (Bahdanau, Cho, and Bengio 2015; Vaswani et al.\\n2017) as well—and we find it uninformative to think of them as such.\\nInstead, we view it as most closely related to the gating mechanism of traditional RNNs, which is a special case\\n(Theorem1)andalsohasadeeperhistoryofconnectionstoSSMsthroughvariable(input-dependent)discretization\\nof ∆ (Funahashi and Nakamura 1993; Gu, Dao, et al. 2020; Tallec and Ollivier 2018). We also eschew the term\\n“gating” in favor of selection to clarify the overloaded use of former. More narrowly, we use selection to refer to\\nthe mechanistic action of a model to select or ignore inputs and facilitate data interaction along the sequence\\nlength (Section 3.1). Beyond selective SSMs and gated RNNs, other examples may include input-dependent\\nconvolutions (Kosma, Nikolentzos, and Vazirgiannis 2023; Lioutas and Guo 2020; Lutati, Zimerman, and Wolf\\n2023; Yang et al. 2019) and even attention.\\n24B Related Work\\nWe overview several prior works related to our methods. We mention that some of the most closely related models\\ninclude recurrent layers such as S4, S5, and quasi-RNNs; as well as end-to-end architectures such as H3, RetNet,\\nand RWKV.\\nB.1 S4VariantsandDerivatives\\nWe describe a brief overview of some structured SSMs from past work, particularly those that have a relation to\\nour method.\\n• S4 (Gu, Goel, and Ré 2022; Gu, Johnson, Goel, et al. 2021) introduced the first structured SSM, describing\\ndiagonal structure and diagonal plus low-rank (DPLR). It focused on efficient convolutional algorithms for\\nDPLR SSMs due to a connection to continuous-time online memorization (HIPPO) (Gu, Dao, et al. 2020).\\n• DSS (Gupta, Gu, and Berant 2022) first discovered the empirical effectiveness of diagonal structured SSMs by\\napproximating the HIPPO initialization. This was expanded on theoretically in S4D (Gu, Gupta, et al. 2022).\\n• S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023) independently discovered the diagonal SSM approximation, and\\nis the first S4 model to be computed recurrently with the parallel scan. However, this required lowering the\\neffective state dimension, which they accomplished by switching the SSM dimensions from a SISO (single-input\\nsingle-output) to MIMO (multi-input multi-output) formulation. Our proposed S6 shares the scan, but differs\\nby (i) keeping the SISO dimensions, which provides a larger effective recurrent state, (ii) using a hardware-aware\\nalgorithm to overcome the computation issue, (iii) adding the selection mechanism.\\nLu et al. (2023) applied S5 to meta-RL in order to handle resetting the SSM state between episode trajectories.\\nTheir mechanism can be viewed as a particular hard-coded instance of a selection mechanism, where A is\\nmanually set to 0, instead of our learnable mechanism that depends on the input. It would be interesting to\\napply selective SSMs generically to this setting and probe if the model has learned to automatically reset its\\nstate on episode boundaries.\\n• Mega (Ma et al. 2023) introduced a simplification of S4 to be real- instead of complex- valued, giving it an\\ninterpretation of being an exponential moving average (EMA). They additionally make an interesting connection\\nof the discretization step of SSMs to an EMA damping term. Contrary to findings in the original S4 papers, this\\nwas the first model to show that real-valued SSMs are empirically effective in certain settings or when combined\\nwith different architectural components.\\n• Liquid S4 (Hasani et al. 2023) is also motivated by augmenting S4 with an input-dependent state transition.\\nFrom this perspective it shares similarity to selection mechanisms, although in a limited form which is still\\ncomputed convolutionally and close to LTI.\\n• SGConv (Y. Li et al. 2023), Hyena (Poli et al. 2023), LongConv (Fu et al. 2023), MultiresConv (J. Shi, K. A.\\nWang, and Fox 2023), and Toeplitz Neural Network (Qin, Han, W. Sun, He, et al. 2023) all focus on the\\nconvolutional representation of S4 and create global or long convolution kernels with different parameterizations.\\nHowever, these methods cannot do fast autoregressive inference directly.\\nNotably, all of these methods, and all other structured SSMs that we are aware of, have been non-selective and\\nusually strictly LTI (linear time invariant).\\nB.2 SSMArchitectures\\nWe use SSM architectures or state space neural networks (SSNN) to refer to deep neural network architectures\\nincorporating one of the previous SSMs as a black box layer.\\n• GSS (Mehta et al. 2023) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs. It is motivated by\\nthe gated attention unit (GAU) of Hua et al. (2022) and looks quite similar to our block, except with additional\\nprojections. Most importantly, its projection contracts the model dimension to reduce the state size of the\\nSSM, while ours expands the model dimension in order to increase the state size, based on the motivation in\\nSection 3.1.\\n25• Mega (Ma et al. 2023) combined the EMA simplification of S4 described above into a hybrid architecture using\\nan efficient attention approximation.\\n• H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) is motivated by combining S4 with linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020).\\nIt is the first to generalize this formulation of linear attention to more general recurrences, which is also the\\nbasis of later architectures.\\n• Selective S4 (J. Wang et al. 2023) incorporates S4 as a black box to generate a binary mask which is multiplied\\non the input. While sharing the “selection” name, we consider this an architectural modification that is closer to\\narchitectural gating than a selection mechanism (Appendix A). For example, we hypothesize that it would not\\nsolve the Selective Copying task because simply masking out the irrelevant inputs does not affect the spacing\\nbetween the relevant ones (indeed, the Selective Copying task can even be viewed as coming pre-masked if the\\nnoise tokens are embedded to 0).\\n• RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) is also based on Linear Attention and very similar to H3, but reduces the inner S4\\nlayer to a special case where the state dimension is 𝑁 =1. Although not framed as such, its recurrence can be\\nviewed as a special case of a linear SSM.\\nIts primary source of improvement is using a linear attention with large head dimension, which can be viewed as\\nanother method to perform input-dependent state expansion. Using a larger head dimension in the context\\nof linear attention variants was first done by H3, but not extensively used since this requires a proportional\\namount of extra computation. RetNet avoids this with an alternate way to parallelize the computation with a\\nvariant of standard multi-head attention instead of convolutions, made feasible by their particular special case\\nof SSMs which acts as a simple EMA.\\n• RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is another recent RNN designed for language modeling. It is based on AFT\\n(attention-freeTransformer(S.Zhaietal.2021)),anothervariantoflinearattention. Itsmain“WKV” mechanism\\ninvolves LTI recurrences and can be seen as the ratio of two SSMs.\\nWe also highlight the gated attention unit (GAU) from Hua et al. (2022), which was motivated by combining the\\nTransformer’s MHA and MLP blocks together and was an inspiration for our architecture (Section 3.4) combining\\nthe H3 and MLP blocks.\\nB.3 RelationshiptoRNNs\\nRNNs and SSMs are broadly related, as they both involve the concepts of recurrence on a latent state.\\nSeveral older RNNs such as the strongly typed RNN (Balduzzi and Ghifary 2016), quasi-RNN (QRNN) (Bradbury\\net al. 2016), and simple recurrent unit (SRU) (Lei 2021; Lei et al. 2017) involve forms of gated RNNs without\\ntime-wise nonlinearities. Because of the connections of gating mechanisms and selection mechanisms, these can be\\nviewed as cases of selective SSMs, and are thus more powerful in a sense than the family of LTI structured SSMs\\nabove. The main differences are:\\n• They do not use state expansion (𝑁 = 1) or selective B,C parameters, both of which are important for\\nperformance (Section 4.6).\\n• They use a heuristic gating mechanism, which we generalize as a consequence of the selection mechanism +\\ndiscretization (Theorem 1). The connections to principled SSM theory provides better parameterizations\\nand initializations (Section 3.6).\\nAdditionally, older RNNs famously suffered from efficiency issues and the vanishing gradients problem (Pascanu,\\nMikolov, and Bengio 2013), both caused by their sequential nature. The latter could be solved for some of the\\nabove RNNs by leveraging the parallel scan (Martin and Cundy 2018), but the former was difficult without theory\\nlater developed for SSMs. For example, modern structured SSMs differ in more careful parameterization of the\\nrecurrent dynamics inspired by classical SSM theory (e.g. through discretization (Gu, Johnson, Goel, et al. 2021;\\nGu, Johnson, Timalsina, et al. 2023)), or direct analysis (Orvieto et al. 2023)).\\nWe also note that there is a long line of work on orthogonal RNNs (Arjovsky, Shah, and Bengio 2016; Henaff,\\nSzlam, and LeCun 2016; Lezcano-Casado and Martínez-Rubio 2019; Mhammedi et al. 2017; Vorontsov et al. 2017)\\n26which are motivated by constraining the A transition matrix to be orthogonal or unitary, in order to control\\nits eigenvalues and prevent the vanishing gradient problem. However, these had other limitations; we believe\\nthat these stem from the fact that orthogonal/unitary RNNs are also LTI. For example, they are almost always\\nevaluated on the Copying task which they can solve perfectly, but observed to struggle on the Selective Copying\\ntask (Jing et al. 2019).\\nB.4 LinearAttention\\nThe Linear Attention (LA) (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) framework is an important result popularizing kernel\\nattention and showing how it relates to recurrent autoregressive models. Many variants have proposed alternative\\nkernels and other modifications. Random Feature Attention (RFA) (H. Peng et al. 2021) chooses the kernel feature\\nmap to approximate softmax attention (i.e. the exp feature map) using the random Fourier feature approximation\\nof Gaussian kernels (Rahimi and Recht 2007). Performer (Choromanski et al. 2021) finds an approximation\\nto the exponential kernel involving only positive features, which also allows the softmax normalization term.\\nTransNormer (Qin, Han, W. Sun, D. Li, et al. 2022) showed that the LA denominator term can be unstable\\nand proposed replacing it with a LayerNorm. cosFormer (Qin, W. Sun, et al. 2022) augments RFA with a\\ncosine reweighting mechanism that incorporates positional information to emphasize locality. Linear Randomized\\nAttention (Zheng, C. Wang, and L. Kong 2022) generalize RFA from the perspective of importance sampling,\\nand generalize it to provide better estimates of the full softmax kernel (rather than just the exp-transformed\\nnumerator).\\nAside from kernel attention, many other variants of efficient attention exist; the survey Tay, Dehghani, Bahri,\\net al. (2022) offers an extensive categorization of many of these.\\nB.5 LongContextModels\\nLong context has become a popular subject, and several recent models have claimed to scale to longer and longer\\nsequences. However, these are often from a computational standpoint and have not been extensively validated.\\nThese include:\\n• Recurrent Memory Transformer (Bulatov, Kuratov, and Burtsev 2023), a lightweight wrapper around a\\nTransformer backbone. It showed ability to generalize up to 1M sequences but only on synthetic memorization\\ntasks; their main result is similar to our Induction Heads extrapolation experiment (Table 2).\\n• LongNet (Ding et al. 2023), which claimed to scale to 1B length but only evaluated on length <100𝐾 for actual\\ntasks.\\n• Hyena and HyenaDNA (Nguyen, Poli, et al. 2023; Poli et al. 2023), which claimed to leverage up to 1M context.\\nHowever, their experiments trained on proportionally more data at longer contexts, making it hard to conclude\\nif quality improvements at 1M context are due to context length or due to more data and computation.\\n• Sparse Transformer (Child et al. 2019) showed a proof-of-concept of using a strided sparse attention Transformer\\nto model audio waveforms of length 220 = 1048576, although did not discuss performance tradeoffs when\\ncontrolling for computation and model size.\\nIn contrast, we believe this work presents one of the first approaches to meaningfully demonstrate increasing\\nperformance with longer context.\\nC Mechanics of Selective SSMs\\nProofofTheorem1.

With selectivity,\\nSSMs are no-longer equivalent to convolution, but we leverage the parallel associative scan. While SSM scans\\nare theoretically efficient (𝑂(𝐵𝐿𝐷𝑁) FLOPs, scaling linear in 𝐿), training foundation models with selective SSMs\\nrequires them to be efficient on modern hardware (GPUs) as well. We describe how we use kernel fusion and\\nrecomputation to make SSM scan fast and memory-efficient. We evaluate the speed of our scan implementation\\ncompared to convolution and attention in Section 4.5, showing that it is up to 7× times faster than attention at\\nsequence length 32K, and is as memory-efficient as the best attention implementation (FlashAttention).\\nSpeed. On modern hardware accelerators (GPUs) most operations (except matrix multiply) are bounded by\\nmemory-bandwidth (Dao, Fu, Ermon, et al. 2022; Ivanov et al. 2021; Williams, Waterman, and Patterson 2009).\\nThis the case with our scan operation, and we use kernel fusion to reduce the amount of memory IOs, leading to\\nsignificant speedup compared to a standard implementation.\\nThe standard way to implement the scan algorithm in Section 3.2 is to prepare the scan input A,B of size\\n(𝐵,𝐿,𝐷,𝑁) in GPU HBM (high-bandwidth memory, commonly referred to as GPU memory), call a parallel\\nassociativescanimplementationtowritethescanoutputofsize(𝐵,𝐿,𝐷,𝑁)toGPUHBM,thenmultiplythatscan\\noutput with C to produce an output of size (𝐵,𝐿,𝐷). However, this requires the number of memory reads/writes\\non the order of 𝑂(𝐵𝐿𝐷𝑁). We can instead fuse the discretization step, the scan, and the multiplication with C\\ninto one kernel:\\n1. We read in 𝑂(𝐵𝐿𝐷+𝐷𝑁) bytes of memory (∆,A,B,C) from slow HBM to fast SRAM.\\n2. We discretize to produce A,B of size (𝐵,𝐿,𝐷,𝑁) in SRAM.\\n3. We perform a parallel associative scan, yielding intermediate states of size (𝐵,𝐿,𝐷,𝑁) in SRAM.\\n4. We multiply and sum with C, producing outputs of size (𝐵,𝐿,𝐷) and write it to HBM.\\nThis way, we reduce IOs by a factor of 𝑂(𝑁) (the state dimension), which in practice speeds up the operation by\\n20-40 times (Section 4.5).\\n28Table11:(Inductionheads.)Modelsaretrainedonsequencelength28 =256,andtestedonvarioussequencelengthsof26 =64\\nupto220=1048576.(cid:51)denotesperfectgeneralizationaccuracy,while(cid:55)denotesoutofmemory.\\nModel Params TestAccuracy(%)atSequenceLength\\n26 27 28 29 210 211 212 213 214 215 216 217 218 219 220\\nMHA-Abs 137K (cid:51) 99.6 100.0 58.6 26.6 18.8 9.8 10.9 7.8 (cid:55) (cid:55) (cid:55) (cid:55) (cid:55) (cid:55)\\nMHA-RoPE 137K (cid:51) (cid:51) 100.0 83.6 31.3 18.4 8.6 9.0 5.5 (cid:55) (cid:55) (cid:55) (cid:55) (cid:55) (cid:55)\\nMHA-xPos 137K (cid:51) (cid:51) 100.0 99.6 67.6 25.4 7.0 9.0 7.8 (cid:55) (cid:55) (cid:55) (cid:55) (cid:55) (cid:55)\\nH3 153K (cid:51) (cid:51) 100.0 80.9 39.5 23.8 14.8 8.2 5.9 6.6 8.2 4.7 8.2 6.3 7.4\\nHyena 69M∗ 97.7 (cid:51) 100.0 (cid:51) 44.1 12.5 6.6 5.1 7.0 5.9 6.6 6.6 5.9 6.3 9.8\\nMamba 74K (cid:51) (cid:51) 100.0 (cid:51) (cid:51) (cid:51) (cid:51) (cid:51) (cid:51) (cid:51) (cid:51) (cid:51) (cid:51) (cid:51) (cid:51)\\n∗Mostoftheparametersareinlearnablepositionalencodings.\\nFor sequence length 𝐿 too long where we cannot fit the sequence in SRAM (which is much smaller than HBM), we\\nsplit the sequences into chunks and perform the fused scan on each chunk. As long as we have the intermediate\\nscan states, we can continue the scan with the next chunk.\\nMemory. Wedescribehowweusetheclassicaltechniqueof recomputationtoreducethetotalamountofmemory\\nrequired to train selective SSM layers.\\nFrom the way we fuse the forward pass, we do not save the intermediate states of size (𝐵,𝐿,𝐷,𝑁) to avoid memory\\nblowup. However, these intermediate states are necessary for the backward pass to compute gradients. We instead\\nrecompute those intermediate states in the backward pass. Since the inputs ∆,A,B,C and output gradient\\nread from HBM to SRAM are of size 𝑂(𝐵𝐿𝑁 +𝐷𝑁), and the input gradients are also of size 𝑂(𝐵𝐿𝑁 +𝐷𝑁),\\nrecomputation avoids the cost of reading 𝑂(𝐵𝐿𝑁𝐷) elements from HBM. This means that recomputation of the\\nSSM states in the backward pass speeds up the computation compared to storing them and reading them from\\nHBM.\\nBeyond optimizing for the memory requirement of just the scan operation, we also use recomputation to optimize\\nthe memory requirement of the entire selective SSM block (input projection, convolution, activation, scan, output\\nprojection). In particular, we do not save intermediate activations that take a lot of memory but are fast to\\nrecompute (e.g. output of activation function or short convolution). As a result, the selective SSM layer has the\\nsame memory requirement as an optimized Transformer implementation with FlashAttention. In particular, each\\nattention layer (FlashAttention) stores around 12 bytes of activations per token, an each MLP layer stores around\\n20 bytes of activations per token, for a total of 32 bytes ((assuming mixed-precision training in FP16 or BF16)).\\nEach selective SSM stores around 16 bytes of activations per token. Hence two layers of selective SSMs have\\naround the same activation memory as an attention layer and an MLP layer.\\nE Experimental Details and Additional Results\\nE.1 SyntheticTasks\\nSelectiveCopying. Our setting is on sequences of length 4096, with a vocab size of 16 possible tokens (including\\nthe white “noise” token from Figure 2) and requiring models to memorize 16 “data” tokens.

For the MHA-Abs and Mamba models, results are reported after the 25th epoch\\n(8192×25=204800 steps). For the MHA-RoPE and MHA-xPos models, results are reported after the 50th epoch\\n(8192×50=409600 steps). For the LTI H3 and Hyena models, results are reported after the 10th epoch (81920\\nsteps) because they had converged by then and failed to improve further.\\n29Table12: (ScalingLawModelSizes.)

Table 12 specifies the model sizes we use for scaling laws. This is taken directly from the GPT3\\nspecifications (Brown et al. 2020), with very minor modifications. First, we changed the batch size of the 1.3B\\nmodel from 1M tokens to 0.5M tokens, since we did not use enough parallelization to require the larger batch\\nsize. Second, we changed the number of training steps and total tokens to roughly match Chinchilla scaling\\nlaws (Hoffmann et al. 2022), which specify that training tokens should increase proportionally to model size.\\nTrainingRecipes. All models used the AdamW optimizer with\\n• gradient clip value 1.0\\n• weight decay 0.1\\n• no dropout\\n• linear learning rate warmup with cosine decay\\nBy default, the peak learning rate is the GPT3 specification.\\nWe give several models an “improved recipe”, inspired by changes adopted by popular large language models such\\nas PaLM (Chowdhery et al. 2023) and LLaMa (Touvron et al. 2023). These include:\\n• linear learning rate warmup with cosine decay to 1𝑒−5, with a peak value of 5× the GPT3 value\\n• no linear bias terms\\n• RMSNorm instead of LayerNorm\\n• AdamW hyperparameter 𝛽 =(.9,.95) (the GPT3 value) instead of the PyTorch default of 𝛽 =(.9,.999)\\nArchitectureandTrainingDetails. Our models are:\\n• Transformer: The standard Transformer based on GPT3 (Table 12).\\n• Transformer++: A Transformer with an improved architecture, namely rotary positional encodings (Su et al.\\n2021) and SwiGLU MLP (Shazeer 2020), and the improved training recipe above.\\n• Hyena: Interleaving a Hyena block (the H3 block with S4 replaced by a global convolution parameterized by an\\nMLP) with standard MLP blocks. The MLP blocks have expansion factor 2 instead of 4 and the number of\\nlayers is correspondingly increased by 1.5× to preserve parameter count.\\n30• H3++: The H3 architecture with a few modifications, including (i) using the same “thin” Hyena dimensions\\nabove (ii) the improved training recipe above (iii) a linear attention head dimension of 8.\\n• RWKV: The default RWKV model from B. Peng et al. (2023), including its modified MLP block. We also used\\nas much of its specified training recipe as possible, such as increasing the learning rates by 2× or 3× on certain\\nparameters.\\n• RetNet: The default RetNet model from Y. Sun et al. (2023). We also gave it the improved training recipe\\nabove.\\n• Mamba: The standard Mamba architecture, with the improved training recipe.\\nE.2.2 AdditionalScalingLawAblations\\nWe perform additional ablations on the architecture using the same protocol as the 2k context length scaling laws\\nin Figure 4 (Left).\\nMambaArchitecture: InterleavingBlocks. We test the effect of different architectural blocks combined with\\nthe Mamba block. We focus on the viewpoint that the Mamba block is simply the standard SwiGLU block with\\nan extra 𝖼𝗈𝗇𝗏→𝖲𝖲𝖬 path added. This leads to two natural ablations:\\n• What if the Mamba block is interleaved with a standard MLP block, instead of stacked homogenously? This\\ncan also be interpreted as taking Mamba and removing half of the SSMs.\\n• What if the Mamba block is interleaved with MHA (multi-head attention) blocks? This can also be interpreted\\nas taking a Transformer with SwiGLU MLPs (i.e. what we call Transformer++) and simply adding SSMs to the\\nMLP blocks.\\nFigure 9 (Right) shows these variants compared to the original (homogenous) Mamba architecture. Interestingly,\\nneither change matters too much. The Mamba-MLP architecture is only slightly worse, and still better than\\nall models except Transformer++. The Mamba-MHA architecture is only slightly better, which is somewhat\\nsurprising in light of the fact that many recent works have found that combining (LTI) SSMs with Attention can\\nlead to substantial improvements (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023; Fathi et al. 2023; Fathullah et al. 2023; Saon, Gupta,\\nand Cui 2023; Zuo et al. 2022).\\nH3Architecture: TrainingRecipes. Next we ablate differences between the Hyena and H3++ models, our\\nweakest and strongest models outside of Transformer++ and Mamba, particularly to isolate the effect of training\\nrecipes.\\n• Hyena: The Hyena block with its original architecture and GPT3 training recipe (same as Figure 4).\\n• Hyena+: The same architecture but with the improved training recipe described above.\\n• H3+: ThesamearchitectureasHyena+butwiththeHyenaconvolutionkernelswappedoutforS4Dconvolution\\nkernel.\\n• H3++: The same as H3+, but with a linear attention head dimension of 8. This increases computation inside\\nthe SSM recurrence but does not increase parameters.\\nOur general convention is that “Model+” represents the base model with the improved training recipe, and\\n“Model++” also allows for architectural changes.\\nFigure 9 (Right) shows that\\n• A large improvement is achieved by the improved training recipe, which was used for many of the models in the\\nmain Figure 4 (RetNet, H3++, Transformer++, Mamba).\\n• The choice of the inner LTI SSM does not matter (e.g. Hyena vs. S4), consistent with findings throughout this\\npaper.\\n• The head dimension expansion improves performance, consistent with one of our main themes that expanded\\nstate dimension improves performance for SSMs (Section 3).\\n31\\x007\\x00G\\x00E\\x00P\\x00M\\x00R\\x00K\\x00\\x04\\x000\\x00E\\x00[\\x00W\\x00\\x04\\x00S\\x00R\\x00\\x04\\x008\\x00L\\x00I\\x00\\x04\\x004\\x00M\\x00P\\x00I\\x00\\x04\\x00\\x0c\\x007\\x00I\\x00U\\x00Y\\x00I\\x00R\\x00G\\x00I\\x00\\x04\\x000\\x00I\\x00R\\x00K\\x00X\\x00L\\x00\\x04\\x00\\x16\\x00\\x14\\x00\\x18\\x00\\x1c\\x00\\r \\x007\\x00G\\x00E\\x00P\\x00M\\x00R\\x00K\\x00\\x04\\x000\\x00E\\x00[\\x00W\\x00\\x04\\x00S\\x00R\\x00\\x04\\x008\\x00L\\x00I\\x00\\x04\\x004\\x00M\\x00P\\x00I\\x00\\x04\\x00\\x0c\\x007\\x00I\\x00U\\x00Y\\x00I\\x00R\\x00G\\x00I\\x00\\x04\\x000\\x00I\\x00R\\x00K\\x00X\\x00L\\x00\\x04\\x00\\x16\\x00\\x14\\x00\\x18\\x00\\x1c\\x00\\r\\n\\x001\\x00E\\x00Q\\x00F\\x00E \\x00,\\x00]\\x00I\\x00R\\x00E\\n\\x001\\x00E\\x00Q\\x00F\\x00E\\x00\\x11\\x001\\x000\\x004 \\x00,\\x00]\\x00I\\x00R\\x00E\\x00\\x0f\\n\\x001\\x00E\\x00Q\\x00F\\x00E\\x00\\x11\\x001\\x00,\\x00% \\x00,\\x00\\x17\\x00\\x0f\\n\\x00\\x15\\x00\\x14\\x00\\x15 \\x00,\\x00\\x17\\x00\\x0f\\x00\\x0f\\n\\x00\\x1d\\x00\\x82\\x00\\x15\\x00\\x14\\x00\\x14\\n\\x00\\x15\\x00\\x14\\x00\\x15\\n\\x00\\x1c\\x00\\x82\\x00\\x15\\x00\\x14\\x00\\x14\\n\\x00\\x1b\\x00\\x82\\x00\\x15\\x00\\x14\\x00\\x14\\n\\x00\\x15\\x00\\x14\\x00\\x15\\x00\\x1d \\x00\\x15\\x00\\x14\\x00\\x16\\x00\\x14 \\x00\\x15\\x00\\x14\\x00\\x15\\x00\\x1d \\x00\\x15\\x00\\x14\\x00\\x16\\x00\\x14\\n\\x00*\\x000\\x003\\x004\\x00W\\x00\\x04\\x00\\x0c\\x00P\\x00S\\x00K\\x00\\x04\\x00W\\x00G\\x00E\\x00P\\x00I\\x00\\r \\x00*\\x000\\x003\\x004\\x00W\\x00\\x04\\x00\\x0c\\x00P\\x00S\\x00K\\x00\\x04\\x00W\\x00G\\x00E\\x00P\\x00I\\x00\\r\\nFigure9:(Scalinglaws:extraablations.)(Left)Insteadof(Right)Insteadof\\nE.2.3 DownstreamEvaluationDetails\\nThis pretraining procedure is the same as the scaling law protocol, but extended to 300B tokens.

HyenaDNA always takes a fixed\\nsub-segment (e.g. the beginning or middle of the prescribed segment), and thus for any training sequence length\\neach epoch is fixed to 34021 samples and doesn’t necessarily go through the whole genome. On the other hand, we\\nuse the entire training data:\\n• When the context length 𝐿 is less than (or equal to) 217 , we divide up each segment into non-overlapping\\nsub-segments of length 𝐿, so that there are 𝑆×\\n217\\ntotal samples and 𝑆×217 ≈4.5𝐵 tokens per epoch.\\n𝐿\\n• When the context length 𝐿 is greater than 217 , we turn each segment into two samples, one that begins with the\\nprescribed segment and one that ends with the prescribed segment. Thus each epoch has 2𝑆 items and 2𝑆𝐿\\n32\\n\\x00\\r\\x00I\\x00P\\x00E\\x00G\\x00W\\x00\\x04\\x00K\\x00S\\x00P\\x00\\x0c\\x00\\x04\\x00]\\x00X\\x00M\\x00\\\\\\x00I\\x00P\\x00T\\x00V\\x00I\\x004 \\x00\\r\\x00I\\x00P\\x00E\\x00G\\x00W\\x00\\x04\\x00K\\x00S\\x00P\\x00\\x0c\\x00\\x04\\x00]\\x00X\\x00M\\x00\\\\\\x00I\\x00P\\x00T\\x00V\\x00I\\x004tokens per epoch. For example, at sequence length 218 =262144 there are 4× as many tokens as the default,\\nand at sequence length 220 there are 16× as many tokens.\\nOther training details generally follow the same protocol as our language modeling experiments (Appendix E.2).\\nFor example, we use the AdamW with (𝛽 1,𝛽 2)=(0.9,0.95), no dropout, weight decay 0.1. We use a cosine learning\\nrate scheduler with linear warmup for 10% of total steps.\\nE.3.2 Scaling: ModelSizeDetails\\nModels. The models we consider are:\\n• Transformer++: a Transformer with improved architecture, notably the usage of RoPE positional encodings (Su\\net al. 2021). Informally, we found these to be noticeably better than vanilla positional encodings from (Vaswani\\net al. 2017).\\n• HyenaDNA: the Hyena model from Nguyen, Poli, et al. (2023) and Poli et al. (2023), which is roughly a\\nTransformer with the MHA block replaced by an H3 block using a global convolution parameterized by an MLP.\\n• Mamba: the standard Mamba architecture.\\nModelSizes. We use the following model sizes.\\nBlocks 4 5 6 7 8 10 12\\nModelDimension 64 96 128 192 256 384 512\\nParams(Approx.) 250K 700K 1.4M 3.5M 7.0M 19.3M 40.7M\\nNotethatthenumberofblocksforMambaisdoubled,becauseoneTransformer“layer” includesboththeMHAand\\nMLPblocks(andsimilarlyforHyena), whichrequirestwoMambablockstomatchparameters(Section3.4).\\nTraining. For each model (Transformer++, HyenaDNA, Mamba), we swept the learning rate across {1𝑒−3,2𝑒−\\n3,4𝑒−3,8𝑒−3}. The optimal Transformer and HyenaDNA learning rates were 2e-3 across all sizes. The optimal\\nMamba learning rate was 8e-3; note that Mamba performed better than baselines with matched learning rates\\n(2e-3), but was more stable and improved even more at higher learning rates. (Furthermore, as this LR is on the\\nupper range of the sweep, it is possible that our results are still suboptimal.)\\nNote that, in contrast to standard LM scaling laws (Table 12), our LR held constant across model sizes for\\nsimplicity. The optimal LR should go down for larger models, but we didn’t find a noticeable effect at the small\\nmodel sizes (at most a few million parameters) we considered.\\nE.3.3 Scaling: ContextLengthDetails\\nWe use a total batch size of 224 ≈ 16𝑀 tokens per training step, for every sequence length (e.g. at length 220\\nthere are 16 segments per batch and at length 210 there are 16384 segments per batch). This is a large batch size\\nrelative to the model size by usual LM standards, but note that a batch size of\\n223\\nis the minimum possible on a\\nmachine with 8 GPUs and sequence length of\\n220,\\nand that HyenaDNA used much larger batches of\\n228\\n.\\nThe learning rate used was 0.008 for Mamba and 0.001 for HyenaDNA; we initially attempted to use the same\\nlearning rate of 0.002 from the previous section for HyenaDNA, but found that it was unstable at the longest\\ncontext length.\\nSequenceLengthWarmup. Following (Nguyen, Poli, et al. 2023), we use sequence length warmup (SLW)\\nduring pretraining. We choose a simple schedule of 2 epochs at each power-of-two sequence length starting from\\n210 =1024. (Note that because of how data is curated, at the longest sequence lengths more steps and tokens are\\nspent proportionally. In particular, each stage up to length 217 processes the same number of tokens, but 4× as\\nmany tokens are processed at length 218 , 8× as many at length 219 , and 16× as many at length 220 .)\\nUnlikeHyenaDNA,wealwayscontrolforthenumberoftokenspergradientupdate,sothebatchsizeissuccessively\\nhalved as the sequence lengths are doubled in each stage.\\n33Table13: (GreatApesDNAClassification.)

Note that we control for the total number of elements in the loss function per gradient step.\\nThepretrainingobjectiveincludesallpositionsacrossthesequencelength,sothat𝚋𝚊𝚝𝚌𝚑_𝚜𝚒𝚣𝚎×𝚜𝚎𝚚𝚞𝚎𝚗𝚌𝚎_𝚕𝚎𝚗𝚐𝚝𝚑\\nis held constant; in other words, the batch size decreases as the sequence length increases. However, for a\\nclassification task, since only the last position enters the loss, the batch size itself is held constant. Note that this\\nalso means that fine-tuning models with longer sequence lengths is more computationally expensive.\\nTraining consists of 10 epochs, each of which has 1024 gradient steps. Each gradient step uses batch size 64, which\\nare all independently randomly drawn by uniformly picking a species, uniformly picking a chromosome, and then\\nuniformly picking a contiguous segment of DNA.\\nFollowing (Nguyen, Poli, et al. 2023), models with a maximum context length greater than 214 = 16384 use\\nsequence length warmup with 1 epoch at length 214 =16384, 1 epoch at length 215 =32768, 1 epoch at length\\n216 =65536, and so on up to the maximum sequence length. For example, the model with 220 =1048576 context\\nundergoes 6 epochs of sequence length warmup before 4 more epochs at its maximum sequence length.\\nThe learning rate for all Hyena models is 𝟺𝚎−𝟻, while the learning rate for all Mamba models is 𝟷𝚎−𝟺. These\\nwere found by performing learning rate sweeps for each model among {1𝑒−5,2𝑒−5,4𝑒−5,1𝑒−4,2𝑒−4} for\\nthe smaller sequence lengths\\n(210,212,214,216),\\nand these values were consistently found to be the best for each\\nmodel. An abridged learning rate sweep was done at length\\n218\\n, which agreed with these values, and a single run\\nat length\\n220\\nwas performed (as described above, the computational cost of these experiments is proportional to\\nthe sequence length). The learning rate followed a cosine decay schedule with warmup with 5 epochs of linear\\nwarmup to the maximum learning rate, and 5 epochs of cosine decay down to 1𝑒−6. The unusually long learning\\nrate warmup schedule was chosen because the sequence length warmup was also long (e.g. comprising 6 out of 10\\nepochs for the model with context length\\n220\\n); we did not experiment with this choice.\\nResults for the Species classification task are in Table 13.\\nE.4 AudioDetails\\nE.4.1 YouTubeMixAudioPretraining\\nModel.

The rest of our sequence lengths are defined by successively halving this and\\nrounding up to the nearest multiple of 2048.\\nTable 14 lists the specifications used in Figure 7. Beyond the varying batch sizes, the number of valid segments in\\nthe training set varied between different sequence lengths (e.g. the number of training steps per epoch was not\\nconstant for different points in the graph), which may have contributed to kinks in the scaling curves.\\nTraining. Models were trained for 200𝐾 training steps with a maximum learning rate of 0.002, 20𝐾 (10%)\\nwarmup steps, and weight decay 0.1 (similar to our general pretraining recipe across domains).\\nAdditionalAblations: SSMParameterizations. We investigate SSM parameterizations on long-form audio\\nwaveform pretraining in the setting of Figure 7. The setting is modified slightly to use larger models (8 layers and\\n𝐷 =64 for 6M params, the SaShiMi default), shorter sequences (211 =2048 to 218 =262144 instead of 213 to 220 ),\\nlower LR (0.001 from 0.002), and shorter training cycles (100K instead of 200K steps).\\nFigure10showsthatthechangefromS4→S6(i.e.theselectionmechanism)isnotalwaysbeneficial. Onlong-form\\naudio waveforms, it in fact significantly hampers performance, which may be intuitive from the point of view\\nthat audio is uniformly sampled and very smooth, and therefore benefits from continuous linear time-invariant\\n(LTI) methods. After ablating away the selection mechanism, note that the resulting model is the S4 layer\\ninside the Mamba block. To disambiguate, we call this Mamba-S4 as opposed the default Mamba architecture\\nMamba-S6.\\nHowever, on the right side, we keep the outer layers of the U-Net Mamba-S4 and ablate only the inner layers.\\nThe performance differences shrink dramatically; this reinforces the hypothesis that layers closer to the raw audio\\nsignal should be LTI, but once they are “tokenized” and compressed by the outer layers, the inner layers no longer\\nneed to be LTI. In this setting however, the real-valued SSM still underperforms the complex-valued one.\\n35\\n\\x00I\\x00X\\x00]\\x00&\\x00\\x04\\x00V\\x00I\\x004\\x00\\x04\\x00W\\x00X\\x00M\\x00& \\x00I\\x00X\\x00]\\x00&\\x00\\x04\\x00V\\x00I\\x004\\x00\\x04\\x00W\\x00X\\x00M\\x00&E.4.2 SC09SpeechGeneration\\nAutoregressive training largely followed the autoregressive language modeling protocol, such as\\n• Weight decay 0.1\\n• Learning rate warmup for 10% of total steps\\n• AdamW optimizer with 𝛽 =(0.9,0.95)\\n• Gradient clip value 0.1\\nWe used a learning rate of 0.002 and 200000 training steps at a batch size of 16.\\nThe large Mamba model in Table 4 has 15 layers per stage with an outer dimension of 𝐷 =96 and pooling factor\\n4.

We compare the core operation of selective SSMs, which is the parallel scan (Section 3.3),\\nagainst convolution and attention, measured on an A100 80GB PCIe GPU. Note that these do not include the cost\\nof other operations outside of this core operation, such as computing the convolutional kernel in global-convolution\\nmodels, or computing the QKV projections in attention.\\nAs a baseline, we implement a standard parallel scan in PyTorch with no kernel fusion. This requires materializing\\nthe parameters A,B,C in HBM.\\nOur scan implementation fuses the discretization step and the parallel scan, avoiding the cost of materializing all\\nthe large parameters in HBM.\\nFor convolution, we use the standard implementation in PyTorch, which separately performs FFTs on the inputs\\nand the filters, multiply them in frequency domain, then performs an inverse FFT to obtain the result. The\\ntheoretical complexity is 𝑂(𝐿log(𝐿)) for sequence length 𝐿.\\nFor attention, we compare against the fastest implementation that we are aware of (FlashAttention-2 (Dao 2023)),\\nwith causal mask. Note that FlashAttention-2 with causal mask is about 1.7× faster than without causal mask,\\nsince approximately only half of the attention entries are computed.\\nWe use batch size of 1 and increase the sequence length from 29 = 512, 210 ≈ 1𝐾, 211 ≈ 2𝐾, up to 219 ≈ 500𝐾\\n(some of the baselines run out of memory before reaching 500K). We use a model dimension of 𝐷 =1024 and state\\ndimension 𝑁 =16. We measure with BF16 inputs, which is the data type most commonly used for large scale\\ntraining.\\nEnd-to-endInference. We measure the inference throughput of a Mamba 1.4B model and an untrained Mamba\\n6.9B model, against a standard Transformer (GPT3 architecture) at 1.3B and 6.7B size. We use the standard\\nTransformer implementation in the Huggingface transformers library.\\nWesetthepromptlengthtobe2048andthegenerationlengthtobe128.
